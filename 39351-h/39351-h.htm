<h2>THE WAR IN SOUTH AMERICA.</h2>

<h4>(<i>From our Correspondent on the Spot.</i>)</h4>

<p class="author"><i>There or Thereabouts, Saturday.</i></p>

<p>I hope you will not believe all you hear. I am told that the
messages are tampered with, but this I trust to get through the lines
without difficulty. It is being carried by a professional brigand
disguised as a monk.</p>

<p>First let me disabuse the minds of your readers about the blowing
up of the hospital. It is quite true that the place was sent
spinning into the air. But the patients were put to the minimum of
inconvenience. They were removed from the wards
without being called upon to quit their beds. They went
somewhere after returning to the ground, but where I
do not know. Some of the local doctors say that the
change of air (caused by the explosion) may have done
them good. It is not impossible.</p>

<p>I am glad to be able to contradict the report that
the Stock Exchange and the apple-stall at the corner were
both bombarded. This is a deliberate falsehood. The
Stock Exchange, it is true, was razed to the ground,
but the apple-stall escaped uninjured. This is an example
of the reckless fashion in which reports are circulated.</p>

<p>Then about the burning of the city. It is certainly true
that the place was set alight in two hundred places at once.
But the day was cold, and I think it was only done because the troops
wanted to warm their hands. You must not believe all you hear, and it
is unwise to impute motives before receiving explanations. The people
here are warm-hearted and sympathetic, and the soldiers (as a body)
are the mildest-mannered persons imaginable.</p>

<p>And the report about the blowing-up of the bridges. Here again
there has been gross exaggeration. The bed of the river, in spite of
reports to the contrary, was left undisturbed. Only the stone-work
was sent spinning, and yet some reporters insist that everything was
blown into smithereens! Reporters really should be more careful.</p>

<p>And now I must conclude, as my brigand, disguised as a priest,
is just off.</p>

<p>As a parting request, I would urge upon my stockbrokers
to buy. We are sure to have a rise presently,
and I predict this with the greater confidence
as I know that the house in which I am writing is undermined.</p>

<p class="ind">The <i>P. M. Magazine</i> goes in for discussion of
Bi-metallism. Sir <span class="sc">John Lubbock</span> writes about "The
Case for Gold," and Mr. <span class="sc">Vicary Gibbs</span>, M.P., about
"The Case for Silver." Considering the relative value
of the metals, the case for gold ought to be out
and away the stronger of the two, impregnable, and
burglar-proof, so that it could be advertised thus:
"It's no use having gold unless you have Sir <span class="sc">John
Lubbock's</span> 'case for gold' to keep it in."</p>

<p><i>Philanthropist Press-Man.</i> "<span class="sc">Oh stop, stop, Mister Lion! Wait a bit! Perhaps the pretty Creature means no harm!</span>"</p>

<p><i>Leo (curtly).</i> "<span class="sc"><i>Look at his Teeth!</i></span>"</p></div>

<blockquote><p>[Mr. <span class="sc">Rider Haggard</span> (writing to the <i>Times</i>) remarks that a considerable
section of the English Press seems to be of opinion that <span class="sc">Lobengula</span> is an
innocent and worthy savage, on whom a quarrel is being forced by the
Chartered Company for its own mercenary ends. He suggests that the appearance
of an armed Matabele impi in Mayfair might alter their views.]</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem2">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Behemoth is big and black, and monstrous-mouthed and toothfull,</p>
<p>But to say he is carnivorous were cruelly untruthful!"</p>
<p>So quoth the Querulous Quillman, or Pen-armed Philanthropist,</p>
<p>Whose intellect seems ever in a sentimental mist.</p>
<p>Now Leo, little given to read books on Natural History,</p>
<p>Was watchful of Dame Nature's <i>facts</i>. "It seems to me a mystery</p>
<p>My querulous Press Porcupine," observed the wary Lion,</p>
<p>"That what you've set your heart on, you can never keep clear eye on.</p>
<p><i>Look at his teeth!</i>" "Oh, nonsense!" cried the Querulous Quillman, quoting</p>
<p>From a book on Big Mammalia, to which he'd been devoting</p>
<p>All his odd moments recently. "Those tusks may look terrific,</p>
<p>But the monster's graminivorous, and pleasant, and pacific.</p>
<p>They're solely meant for cutting grass! Huge uppers and big lowers,</p>
<p>Though threatening as ripping-saws, are harmless as lawn-mowers.</p>
<p>As weapons of offence they're seldom used, so here 'tis stated,</p>
<p>'Unless the creature's wounded sore, or greatly irritated.'</p>
<p>He is innocent and worthy, this Titanic-jawed Colossus.</p>
<p>Those gleaming tusks won't 'chump' you, he won't trample us, or toss us,</p>
<p>Unless we interfere with him. He likes to stand there grinning,</p>
<p>With those terrible incisors, in a way which mayn't be winning,</p>
<p>Still, <i>'tis but his style of smiling</i>, and it's not his fault, poor fellow!</p>
<p>If his maw's a crimson cavern, and his tusks are huge and yellow."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Behemoth meanwhile snorted in his own earthquaky fashion,</p>
<p>And yawned, and lashed and trampled like a tiger in a passion.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
<p>By the gleaming of his optics, and the clashing of his tushes,</p>
<p>He <i>seemed</i> to be preparing for the Ugliest of Rushes.</p>
<p>Quoth Leo, "Good friend Porcupine, you <i>may</i> be quite prophetic,</p>
<p>And I a bit 'too previous.' Your picture's most pathetic;</p>
<p>But I've seen your pachydermatous Poor Innocent when furious,</p>
<p>And for a gentle graminivorous creature, it is curious</p>
<p>How he'll run amuck like a Malay, and crunch canoes and foes up,</p>
<p>With those same tusks, which might have made a Mammoth turn his toes up.</p>
<p>So if you please, friend Porcupine, your quills I shall not trust again</p>
<p>To meet those spears, which hate would wash&mdash;in blood, 'ere they should rust again.</p>
<p>Mere quills won't quell an Impi, or make Behemoth good-neighbourly.</p>
<p>Leo must guard this spot, where British enterprise and labour lie,</p>
<p>The Monster seems to meditate attack, if <i>I</i> may judge of him,</p>
<p>So let <i>me</i> have the first slap at, whilst you keep on scribbling fudge of him!</p>

<h2>A LETTER HOME.</h2>

<h4>(<i>From our Youngest Contributor.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">My dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;This is about the last letter you will
receive from me. I know it is, as all will soon be over! And I
shall be glad of it. I can't last out until the Christmas holidays.
Who could with such food? Why, it would make a dog cough!</p>

<p>It's no use learning anything. Why should I, when it will be all
over almost directly? What's the good of Latin and Greek if you
are going to chuck it almost at once? And mathematics, too!
What use are they if the end is near? It's all very well to cram,
but what's the good of it when you know you won't survive to eat
the plum pudding?</p>

<p>There's no news. There's never any news. <span class="sc">Smith</span> Minor has
got his cap for football, and <span class="sc">Snooks</span> Major is going up to Oxford
instead of Cambridge. What does it matter when the beef is so
tough that you might sole your boots with it? And as for the
mutton! Well, all I can say is, that it isn't fit for human food, and
the authorities should be told about it. As for me, I am passing
away. No one will ever see me more. For all that, you might send
me a hamper. Your affectionate friend,</p>

<h3>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Scene IX.</span>&mdash;<span class="sc">Charles Collimore's</span> <i>Sitting-room at Keppel Street,
Bloomsbury</i>. <span class="sc">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Saturday afternoon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagney</i> (<i>the landlady, showing</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>in</i>). Oh, I
thought Mr. <span class="sc">Collimore</span> had come in, Sir, but I expect him in every
minute. Will you take a seat?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey</i> (<i>sitting down</i>). Thank you, I'm in no hurry&mdash;no hurry
at all. (<i>To himself.</i>) <span class="sc">Cornelia</span> wished me to put a few questions
quietly to the landlady. I suppose I'd better do it while&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>)
Hem, I hope, Ma'am, that you find Mr. <span class="sc">Collimore</span> a&mdash;an
unexceptionable lodger&mdash;in all respects?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagn.</i> (<i>crossing her hands stiffly in front of her</i>). Mr.
<span class="sc">Collimore</span> conducks hisself as a gentleman, and treats me as a lady,
which is all <i>my</i> requirements.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Quite so&mdash;very satisfactory, I'm sure, but&mdash;does he
keep fairly regular hours? Or is he at all inclined to be&mdash;er&mdash;fast?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagn.</i> (<i>on her guard</i>). I can't answer for the time his watch
keeps, myself. I dessay it goes as reg'lar as what most do.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> No, no; I was referring to his habits. I mean&mdash;does
he usually spend his evenings
quietly at home?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagn.</i> You'll excuse <i>me</i>,
but if you're arsking me all these
questions out of mere himpertinent
curiosity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I&mdash;I trust I have a
higher motive, Ma'am. In fact,
I may as well tell you I am Mr.
<span class="sc">Collimore's</span> uncle.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagn.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). The
old fox! So he's trying to ferret
out something against him, is
he? Well, he <i>won't</i>&mdash;that's all.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) If you <i>are</i> his huncle,
Sir, all I can say is, you've got a
nephew to be proud on. I wouldn't
wish to let my first floor to a
steadier or a more industrious
young gentleman; comes in
punctual to a tick every night of
his life and 'as his dinner, and
sets studyin' his book till 'alf-past
ten, which is his bed-time.
I don't know what more you
want.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). This is
really very satisfactory&mdash;if I could
only believe it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) But do
I understand you to say that that
is his invariable practice? Occasionally,
I suppose, he goes out to
a place of amusement&mdash;such as a
music-hall, now?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagn.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). Well,
he may; and why not? He don't
get into no mischief, though light-'earted.
<i>I</i> ain't going to give him
a bad name. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Lor, Sir,
don't you go and put such ideas
into his 'ed. Bless your 'art alive,
if he knows there <i>are</i> such places, it's as much as he does know!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>testily</i>). Now, now, my good woman, I'm afraid you're
trying to deceive me. I happen to know more about my nephew's
tastes and pursuits than you imagine.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagn.</i> (<i>roused</i>). Then, if you know so much, whatever do
you come 'ere and ask <i>me</i> for? It's my belief you ain't up to no
good, for all you look so respectable, comin' into my 'ouse a-pokin'
your nose into what don't concern you, for all the world like a poll-pryin',
sneakin' Russian spy!</p>

<p><i>Charles</i> (<i>entering behind her</i>). Hallo, Mrs. <span class="sc">Cagney</span>, what's all
this&mdash;who's a Russian spy, eh? (<i>Recognising</i> <span class="sc">Mr. Toovey</span>.) What&mdash;Uncle!
you don't mean to say it's <i>you</i>?</p>

<p class="ind2">[Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>stands stricken with confusion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Cagn.</i> I may have spoke too free, Mr. <span class="sc">Collimore</span>, Sir, but
when a party, as is elderly enough to know better, tries to put
under'and questions to me about where and 'ow any o' my gentlemen
pass their hevenins, and if they go to the music-'all and what not&mdash;why,
I put it to you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> All right, Mrs. <span class="sc">Cagney</span>, put it to me some other time; you
didn't understand my uncle, that's all&mdash;you needn't stay. Oh, by the
way, I'm dining out again this evening. Tell <span class="sc">Cagney</span> to leave the
chain, as I may be late. (<i>After</i> Mrs. C. <i>has retired</i>.) Well, Uncle,
I'm afraid your diplomacy hasn't had quite the success it deserved.</p>

<p class="center">"Mr. Collimore conducks hisself as a gentleman, and treats me as a lady."</p></div>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>sheepishly</i>). I assure you, my boy, that I&mdash;I was not
inquiring for my own satisfaction. Your Aunt is naturally anxious
to know how you&mdash;&mdash; But your landlady gave you an excellent
character.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> She didn't seem to be equally complimentary to <i>you</i>,
Uncle. "A Russian spy," wasn't it? But really, you know, you
might have come to me for any information you require. <i>I</i> don't
mind telling you all there is to tell. And surely Aunt knows I've
been to a music-hall; why, she pitched into me about it enough
last Sunday!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I&mdash;I think she wanted to know whether you went
frequently, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, or only that once.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Oh, and so she sent you up to pump my landlady? Well,
I'll tell you exactly how it is. I don't set up to be a model young
man like your friend <span class="sc">Curphew</span>. I don't spend all my evenings
in this cheerful and luxurious apartment. Now and then I find the
splendour of the surroundings rather too much for me, and I'm
ready to go anywhere, even to a music-hall, for a change. There,
I blush to say, I spend an hour or two, smoking cigars, and even
drinking a whisky and soda, or a lemon squash, listening to middle-aged
ladies in sun-bonnets and accordion skirts singing out of tune.
I don't know that they amuse me much, but, at all events, they're
livelier than Mrs. <span class="sc">Cagney</span>. I'm
dining out to-night, at the Criterion,
with a man at the office,
and it's as likely as not we shall
go in to the Valhalla or the Eldorado
afterwards. There, you can't
say I'm concealing anything from
you. And I don't see why you
should groan like that, Uncle.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>feebly</i>). I&mdash;I'd
rather you didn't go to the&mdash;the
Eldorado, <span class="sc">Charles</span>.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> There's ingratitude!
I thought you'd be touched by
my devotion.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I <i>can't</i>
tell him I was thinking of going
there myself! (<i>Aloud.</i>) You
will show your devotion best by
keeping away. The less young
men go to such places, my boy,
the better!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Not for <i>you</i>, Uncle.
You forget that it's the humble
five bob of fellows like me that help
to provide your next dividend.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>wincing</i>). Don't,
<span class="sc">Charles</span>, it&mdash;it's ungenerous and
undutiful to reproach me with
being a shareholder when you
know how innocently I became
one!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But I <i>wasn't</i> reproaching
you, Uncle, it was rather the
other way round, wasn't it? And
really, considering you <i>are</i> a shareholder
in the Eldorado, it's a
little too strong to condemn me
for merely going there.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I&mdash;I may not be a
shareholder long, <span class="sc">Charles</span>. Unless
I can conscientiously feel able to retain my shares I shall take
the first opportunity of selling them.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But why, Uncle? Better stick to them now you have
got them!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> What? with the knowledge that I was profiting by
practices I disapproved of? Never, <span class="sc">Charles</span>!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But you can't <i>sell</i> without making a profit, you know;
they've gone up tremendously.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Oh, dear me! Then, do you mean that I shouldn't
even be morally justified in selling them? Oh, you don't think
<i>that</i>, <span class="sc">Charles</span>?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> That's a point you must settle for yourself, Uncle, it's
beyond me. But, as a dutiful nephew, don't you see, I'm bound to
do all I can in the meantime to keep up the receipts for you, if I
have to go to the Eldorado every evening and get all the fellows I
know to go too. Mustn't let those shares go down, whether you hold
on or sell, eh?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>horrified</i>). Don't make me an excuse for encouraging
young men to waste precious time in idleness and folly. I won't
allow it&mdash;it's abominable, Sir! You've put me in such a state of
perplexity by all this, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, I&mdash;I hardly know where I am!
Tell me, are you really going to the Eldorado this evening?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> I can't say; it depends on the other fellow. But I will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span>
if I can get him to go, for your sake. And I'm afraid I ought to go
and change, Uncle, if you'll excuse me. Make yourself as comfortable
as you can. Here's to-day's <i>Pink 'Un</i>, if you haven't
seen it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I'm not in the habit of seeing such periodicals, Sir. And
I must be going. Oh, by the bye, your Aunt wished me to ask you
to come down and dine and sleep on Monday next. <span class="sc">Thea</span> will be
back, and I believe Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> has got a free evening for once.
Shall I tell her you will come, <span class="sc">Charles</span>?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Thanks; I'll come with pleasure. But, I say, Aunt
doesn't want to give me another lecture, I hope? After all, she can't
say much if you've told her about those shares, as I suppose you have.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> N&mdash;not yet, <span class="sc">Charles</span>. I have not found a convenient
opportunity. There, I can't stay&mdash;good-bye, my boy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I'm afraid <span class="sc">Charles</span> has lost every
particle of respect for me. I wish I had never told him about those
wretched shares. And what <i>am</i> I to do now? If I go to this Eldorado
place, he may be there too; and, if he sees me, I shall never
hear the last of it! And yet my mind will never be easy unless I do
go and see for myself what it really is like. That young <span class="sc">Curphew</span>
expects me to go. But I don't know, I do so dread the idea of
going&mdash;alone, too! I should like to ask somebody else what he
thinks I ought to do&mdash;somebody who is a man of the world.
I wonder if I went to see <span class="sc">Larkins</span>&mdash;he won't be in his office so late
as this, but I might catch him in his chambers. It was all through
him I got into this difficulty; he ought to help me out of it if he
can. I really think I might take a cab and drive to Piccadilly, on
the chance.</p>

<p>When we have two original plays like <span class="sc">Pinero's</span> <i>Second Mrs.
Tanqueray</i> and <span class="sc">Grundy's</span> <i>Sowing the Wind</i>, we may congratulate
ourselves that they do <i>not</i> "do these things better in France." <i>Mrs.
Tanqueray</i> is a life-like tragedy, and <i>Sowing the Wind</i> a life-like
comedy. It was a pleasure to congratulate Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander</span> at the
St. James's on his choice of a piece, and of the company to suit it,
especially on the engagement of Mrs. <span class="sc">Patrick Campbell</span> for the
heroine; and now it is equally pleasant to congratulate a <i>confrère</i>
in literature, Mr. <span class="sc">Comyns Carr</span>, on having made so eminently
successful a <i>début</i> in theatrical management, as he has done in
choice of the piece and of the company to play it.</p>

<p>It is a canon of comedy-construction that from the first,
the audience should be let into the secret of the <i>dénouement</i>,
but that they should be puzzled as to the means by which that
end is to be achieved. This play is an excellent example of the
rule. Everybody knows who the heroine is from the moment of her
appearance; but as to how she, the illegitimate daughter, is to be
recognised and acknowledged by her father, this is the problem
that no one except the dramatist, in the course of four acts, can
solve. It is a very clever piece of workmanship. In these modern
matter-of-fact realistic days, fancy the awful danger to any
play in which a father has to discover his long-lost child! The
strawberry mark on the left arm, the amulet, the duplicate
miniature of the mother&mdash;these ways and means, and many others,
must occur to the playgoer, and must have presented themselves at
the outset to the author, flattering himself on his originality, as
difficulties almost insuperable because so stagey, so worn threadbare,
so out of date.</p>

<p>Over these difficulties Mr. <span class="sc">Grundy</span> has triumphed, and with him
triumph the actors and the stage-manager; as, for the most part,
except when there is a needless conventional "taking the centre"
for supposed effect, the stage management is as admirable as the
acting and the dialogue, which is saying a great deal, but not a
bit too much.</p>

Marquis of Douro, by Mr. Ian Robertson.</p></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Brandon Thomas</span> and Miss
<span class="sc">Emery</span> have never done anything better.
The former with his peculiar north-country
"burr," and with his collars and general make up
reminding many of the G. O. M., whilst Mr. <span class="sc">Ian
Robertson</span> as the wicked old Lord is not unlike the
pictures of the Iron Duke when Lord <span class="sc">Douro</span>. Mr.
<span class="sc">Edmund Maurice</span>, as representing the
slangy, sporting, about-town Baronet of the Tom-and-Jerry
day, is a kind of <i>Goldfinch</i> in <i>The Road
to Ruin</i>, with a similar kind of catchword, which
I suppose, on Mr. <span class="sc">Grundy's</span> authority [though
I do not remember the expression nor the use of the word
"chuck" in <i>Tom and Jerry</i>&mdash;the authority for Georgian era slang]
was one of the slang phrases of that period.
For my part (a very small part), I am inclined
to credit Mr. <span class="sc">Grundy</span> with the
invention of "smash my topper," and of
the introduction of "chuck it" into
eighteenth century London slang.</p>

<p>Admirable are the quaint sketches of
character given by Miss <span class="sc">Rose Leclercq</span> and
Miss <span class="sc">Annie Hughes</span>. Manly and lover-like
is Mr. <span class="sc">Sydney Brough</span>. In the dramatic
unfolding of the plot, faultlessly acted as
it is, the audience from first to last are
thoroughly interested. Here and there,
speeches and scenes would be all the better
for some judicious excision. When you are
convinced, further argument weakens the
case, and I confess I should like to hear
that ten minutes' worth of dialogue had
been taken out of the parts played by Mr.
<span class="sc">Brandon Thomas</span> and Miss <span class="sc">Winifred
Emery</span>. But this is a small matter&mdash;a
very small matter. To sum up, it is good
work and good play, and so the new
manager and lessee is at this present
moment a Triumphal <span class="sc">Carr</span>.</p>

<h2>THE CITY HORSE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>A Legend of the "Coming Ninth."</i>)</h4>

<p>"You <i>must</i> let me have him on the day I have specified," said the
military-looking man, with an air of determination.</p>

<p>"And you order this, Sir, after learning his history?" replied the
well-educated cabman. "You know that he has been in a
circus?"</p>

<p>"I do; it is one of his greatest qualifications. A circus, I think
you said, where there was a brass band?"</p>

<p>"Not only a brass band, but a very brassy band indeed; a brass
band all drum, trombone, and cymbal! A brass band that could be
heard for miles!"</p>

<p>"And he bore it well?" asked the ex-soldier. "He did not mind
the noise?"</p>

<p>"Not he," was the reply. "Why should he mind it? For remember
he was accustomed to insults from the clown. When a horse
regards insults from the clown with equanimity, you may be sure he
will object to nothing."</p>

<p>"And what were the nature of these insults?" queried the
veteran warrior, with renewed interest. "Did the clown push him
about? Did he tell him to gee-up?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. Had he been an unruly crowd at Blackheath on
a Bank Holiday, the clown could not have behaved worse. And
<i>Rufus</i>, poor beast! bore it all&mdash;six nights a week, with a <i>matinée</i>
thrown in on a Saturday&mdash;without complaining."</p>

<p>"And you do not think he would mind being called 'cat's-meat?'
Not even by a rude boy?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, Sir, it is what I often call him myself. <i>Rufus</i> is his
name, but cat's-meat is his nature. But don't you want him for
more than a day? Won't you buy him?"</p>

<p>"No," returned the veteran soldier, sternly. "I only require him
for the Ninth."</p>

<p>"He is getting too old for cabwork," argued the well-read driver.
"He would make a splendid charger for the adjutant of a Yeomanry
corps, and out of training might be put in the harness of a bathing-machine.
No, pray don't interrupt me, Sir. You are going to urge
that he would be useless in the winter. But no, Sir, you are wrong.
He might take round coal (in small quantities), when the nights
draw in. Can I not tempt you, Sir? You shall have him a bargain.
Shall we say a penny a pound?"</p>

<p>"I have already told you," replied the warrior, "that I have
need of him only on the 9th. You understand, the 9th of next
month."</p>

<p>The well-read cab-driver nodded, and the two men parted. It
was a bargain. <i>Rufus</i> (<i>alias</i> "Cat's-meat") was to be ready for
hire on the 9th of November.</p>

<p>"What does he want to do with the brute?" the well-read cabman
asked himself again and again. "Surely he cannot mean to
ride it? And yet he desired to learn if <i>Rufus</i> were up to his
weight; and when I answered Yes, his eyes brightened, and he
regarded the animal with renewed interest."</p>

<p>And all through the day the mystery puzzled him. He could not
solve the problem, try as he would. Suddenly, as he was discussing
a cup of tea in a shelter, a ray of light flooded his perplexed mind.</p>

<p>"Eureka!" he exclaimed; "the warrior must have been the City
Marshal; and he wanted <i>Rufus</i> ('Cat's-meat'), of course, for the
Lord Mayor's Show!" And perhaps the cabman had guessed rightly.

<span class="sc">Hollingshead's</span> advertisement,
headed "Plain Words to the
Public," is eminently characteristic
of the author. Says he,
"The prices I start with I shall
stand or fall by." Certainly, as
the prices are moderate, the
public will stand them, so he
needn't trouble himself on that
score. If he be riding for a
fall, and if the public won't
come down heavily, let us hope,
if he fall at all, he will come
down lightly. Then he adds, in
his own independent way, "If
it is thought necessary to tamper
with these prices in an upward
direction" ["tampering upward"
is pretty], "I shall give
up this, my final effort in
theatrical management" [Oh,
no, don't!&mdash;please don't!!],
"and walk out of the building."
Why "walk"? By his
own free admission he will be
driven out (which sounds like
a contradiction in terms), so
why make a virtue of walking
out. Never walk when you can
ride. But J. H. walk out!!

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
